Most of this information is geared toward preparing your collection for archiving with [PARADISEC](https://www.paradisec.org.au/){:target="_blank"} (Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Engangered Cultures), but some of the organisational concepts can be applied to depositing with other archives such as [The Endangered Language Archive (ELAR)](https://elar.soas.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

### Data management

#### Crafting a data management plan

#### File naming


#### File & directory organisation

#### Preparing for archiving 

### Metadata management tools

At this time there are two metadata tools that we are supporting. Follow the links below to get the most recent versions of each.

#### PARADISEC-configured Spreadsheet
 
 Right-click on this [link](http://www.paradisec.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PDSCMinimalMetadata2020.xlsx){:target="_blank"} to save the PARADISEC pre-configured spreadsheet. All fields necessary to create catalog items in PARADISEC are included.
> Note:  Rows in the PARADISEC spreadsheet are meant to capture metadata at the level of an item, or recording session. Do not list individual file information.

#### LaMeta
This free software will allow you to create metadata files via a simple graphical interface. Follow this [link](https://github.com/onset/laMETA/releases){:target="_blank"} to download the latest version. If you need guidance using LaMeta, take a look at this helpful [blog from ELAR](https://elararchive.org/blog/2020/04/30/introducing-lameta/){:target="_blank"}.

The LaMeta metadata export lends itself for archiving with [ELAR](https://elar.soas.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, creating .imdi metadata files (XML); however, there is an option to export the project metadata as a CSV that is formatted for PARADISEC. This function is in the early stages and your export may require some cleaning up.
