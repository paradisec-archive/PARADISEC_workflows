<sup>1</sup> *If you have files such as .mp3 (audio) or .mpg (video), we will certainly accept them; however, if you are collecting new recordings, please avoid these formats, as they are lossy, compressed formats. Look at the following section for capture suggestions*

#### Post-production processing of media
If you would like to save money (see PARADISEC's page on [Costing a deposit](https://www.paradisec.org.au/deposit/costing-a-deposit/)) or speed up the archiving process, you may provide us with audio files that are already sampled to 96kHz/24bit or video files that are .mp4 (H.264 codec), you can refer to the following pages: [Audio procesing](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/07_audio_processing.html){:target="_blank"} and [Video Processing using FFmpeg](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/08_video_processing_FFmpeg.html){:target="_blank"}.
