## PARADISEC audio processing workflow for archiving
This workflow is targeted toward born-digital audio files; however, should the need arise to adjust audio files originating from various legacy formats, this workflow will help.

### Extracting audio from a video
If you want to extract the audio track from a video file. you can easily do this in two ways, both using software that is freely available:

### Using VLC

### Using FFmpeg
If you want to retain the same audio quality as the source video:
```
ffmpeg -i  <name_of_input_video.extension> <name_of_output_audio.extension>
```

Simply put:
```
ffmpeg -i  video.mp4 audio.wav
```

If the original video (.avi, .mts, .mp4, .mov, etc.) has only one audio channel, or has a sampling or bit rate you want to change, take a look at the previous section on audio processing with ffmpeg.
