FFmpeg is an efficient and cost effective way to process video. It is done by using a command line interface (CLI), but once the workflow is set up, it is relatively simple.


## Installation options
If you are using a Mac, it is a bit more straight forward than the PC as Bash is a Unix shell (command language interpreter) and runs natively on Macs. To download FFmpeg, open a terminal window and first install Homebrew (command line package manager) with the following commands:

1\. Installation links fo Mac:
* Download source code: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac){:target="_blank"} 
* Download using Homebrew: [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg){:target="_blank"}

Because this can be a tricky process to install, here are some helpful sites:

* [Installing ffmpeg and ffprobe on macOS manually](https://bbc.github.io/bbcat-orchestration-docs/installation-mac-manual/){:target="_blank"}

To test if you have installed FFmpeg correctly, just type ```ffmpeg``` in Terminal and enter. Information about the version of FFmpeg as well as enabled libraries should appear in your terminal window as seen in the image below.

As suggested in that final line in the above image, to view the FFmpeg manual in the terminal window, type in:

    man ffmpeg

2\. Installation on Windows
* Download executable file: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows){:target="_blank"}

## Some helpful FFmpeg 'recipes' for using FFmpeg on a Mac

### To transcode .MOV to .MP4 (H.246)

If you have multiple .MOV files you want to transcode:

Place all .MOV files in one folder and navigate to that folder in Terminal. Then type (or copy) this code into the Terminal:

```
for i in *.MOV; do ffmpeg -i ‚Äú$i‚Äù -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset veryslow -crf 18 -c:a aac ‚Äú$(basename ‚Äú$i‚Äù .MOV)‚Äù.mp4 ; done
```
