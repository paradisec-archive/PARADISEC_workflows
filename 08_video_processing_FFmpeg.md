FFmpeg is an efficient and cost effective way to process video. It is done by using a command line interface (CLI), but once the workflow is set up, it is relatively simple.

### Using **FFmpeg** on a Mac

#### Installation
If you are using a Mac, it is a bit more straight forward than the PC as Bash is a Unix shell (command language interpreter) and runs natively on Macs. To download FFmpeg, open a terminal window and first install Homebrew (command line package manager) with the following commands:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"} 

><span style="color:LightBlue">
**‚è∏Ô∏è  TIP:** Check here for any updates to this installation process: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)</span>

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Brew Doctor. This is a self-diagnostic tool to determine if everything is installed correctly.<br>

    brew doctor

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/){:target="_blank"}

**‚è∏Ô∏è  TIP:** Check here for any updates to this installation process: [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg)</span>

    brew install ffmpeg

To test if you have installed FFmpeg correctly, just type ```ffmpeg``` and enter. Information about the version of FFmpeg as well as enabled libraries should appear in your terminal window as seen in the image below.

    man ffmpeg
