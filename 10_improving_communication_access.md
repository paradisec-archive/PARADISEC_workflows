*This working guide was motivated by feedback provided to CoEDL’s Education Committee about the possibility of improving the accessibility of our educational and other public-facing output for deaf and hard of hearing colleagues, and many other people who benefit from captioned content or sign language interpreting services. It is not an exhaustive description of options available, rather it offers some simple workflows for anyone who wants to create captioned content for recordings after-the-fact or to learn more about providing captions or sign language interpreting for in-person or virtual events. We welcome any feedback, questions or suggestions as we move to improve communication access at CoEDL. Please get in touch via the email addresses above.*

Deaf and hard of hearing people have historically been marginalised in academia, and deaf signing people even more so. It is very difficult to request, organise and facilitate effective communication access if you need to use captions and/or a sign language. There are many factors that make this situation difficult. As an example, imagine you are a deaf signing academic, other professional or community member wanting to attend a seminar on a topic relevant to your research and/or community. You must first email the seminar organiser and ask about what (if any) communication access will be provided, and/or set the process in motion for organising your own access. 

Responses can vary, but it is common to receive a response such as, “Sorry, we don’t have the funds, there’s no budget line for this,” and no further engagement. A particularly negative and resistant response can involve upwards of twenty emails as the deaf person seeks to explain and justify why they belong at this seminar, and how they can participate. Or it can involve no response at all. Even a positive response will often come with lots of invisible labour in teaching organisers how to work with sign language interpreters, and dealing with various hiccups that come with learning any new process.From the perspective of a deafperson, it won’t be the first nor the last time this happens. These responses are experienced over and over again in different spaces and with different people. Sometimes access is provided, but only after along and unnecessary battle. Unfortunately, many people experience burn-out and give up along the way. Assolutions can often eventually be found, this suggests the main barrier relates to attitudes more so than budgets.

Some of these responses may feel reasonable from an institutional and bureaucratic perspective, but it does not feel reasonable from a personal and individual one. The prevailing ideology is that communication access is too expensive, which means that deafness and deaf or hard of hearing people are treated as financially unsustainable. This exhausting and harmful to both the deaf person and the academy as a whole. Over time, the cumulative effect is that deaf people and sign languages are not welcomein academic spaces. If the deaf academic or deaf participant is Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander orfromany other underrepresented group who has not historically participated in academia, these issues will be compounded by other barriers resulting from structural racism and other forms of systemic oppression. The result will be that deaf and hard of hearing signing people do not participate and everyone misses out. 

As academics committed to equitable and democratic scholarship, we need to consider the impact that various institutional practices and norms can have on different people who want to participate. Many barriers can be removed by understanding what different forms of discrimination look like and how they can be avoided. This working guide is not exhaustive, as it focuses only on communication access for deaf and hard of hearing people. It is important to recognise that facilitating communication access is not just a response to one individual at one meeting or event. In time, many people will benefit as barriers are removed and the space becomes more equitable.

### Captioning options to improveaccessibility ofyour audio-visualcontent

#### Some terms used
* **Closed captioning vs open captioning**: Closed captions are ones that you can choose to display or not display. YouTube videos will often have CC options, as does Netflix. Open captions are those that cannot be removed from the display. An example is if you have created a subtitled video and burned the text into the video footage(this process will be described below).
* **Automatic captioning**: Auto-captioning uses AI (artificial intelligence) to process the speech to text. YouTube uses this technology (this will be discussed below), as do apps that you can use on your computer or smartphone.
* **Captions vs transcriptions**: Captions are typically presented at the bottom of the video, transcriptions can be provided in a separate file as text, of it can be displayed in a side panel, but not in the video, itself.

#### What type of access could be offered and when?
1. **Captioning pre-recorded content:**
* When lectures, meetings, seminars, or workshopsare recorded live and with no deaf people or others needing captions presentin the audience, these presentations can becaptioned after the event and made available to the public.
* Pre-recorded videos presented at a conference can be captioned prior to sending to conference organisers. Making a captioned version available would greatly improve access to your content.
2. **Live captioning and/or interpreting:** When deaf or hard of hearing colleagues want to access and participate in live lectures, meetings, seminars, or workshops, you should make sure they have access to one or both of the following *(these services may be provided by the participant’s home institution, but this should not be assumed, as affiliation does not guarantee access)*:
