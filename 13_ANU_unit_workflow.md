## Audio workflow

### Workflow for handling analogue open reel or cassette tapes
1. Create inventory of files received
2. Photograph each item, including all tape box inserts, tape labels, written inserts, etc. to capture all written metadata. Image files should be named with the same PI as the audio files. For each tape, archival copies of images should be in tiff (.tif) format. Next, create lower resolution jpeg (.jpg) copies and combine these as a single reduced size .pdf. The .tif images should then be zipped into a single file so that DOIs are not created for each individual file.

><span style="color:DarkBlue">
>**NOTE:** The whole image should be captured, but in some cases it might be desirable to zoom in to the text to make sure it is fully legible in an additional image; even blank surfaces should be photographed to ensure that no metadata has been overlooked. You can place a ruler or a colour separation guide and grey scales patch on the base if you need this level of size or colour precision in your image capture.

3. Follow the digitising instructions outlined [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/06_audio_digitising.html){:target="_blank"}

### Workflow for handling born-digital audio files
1. Create inventory of files received
2. 

## Video workflow

### Workflow for handling video tape formats, film, or other non-file-based video formats
1. Create inventory of files received
2. 

### Workflow for handling born-digital video files
1. Create inventory of files received
	 * It is best to use MediaInfo batch export to collect necessary structural metadata such as overall/max Bitrate (needed for transcoding), duration (needed for QC), etc. (For more information about extracting metadata with MediaInfo, click [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/10_quality_control.html#mediainfo){:target="_blank"}).
	 * If not possible to use MediaInfo batch export, then use MediaInfo app and manually collect necessary metadata.
	 * Minimally, create a list or csv of files (Terminal print dir using "ls" is quickest).

2. Organise files by Bitrate 
3. Use Handbrake, FFmpeg, or MediaEncoder to create .mp4 (H.264), if original files are not already compliant. Follow instructions for Handbrake [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/08a_video_processing_HandBrake.html){:target="_blank"}, FFmpeg [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/08_video_processing_FFmpeg.html){:target="_blank"}, or MediaEncoder [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/09_video_processing_AdobeME.html){:target="_blank"}.
