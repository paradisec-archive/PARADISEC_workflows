## Audio workflow

### Workflow for handling analogue open reel or cassette tapes
1. Create inventory of files received
2. Prepare tapes for digitisation (Audio)
   * Assess tape condition
    ><span style="color:DarkBlue">
    >**NOTE:** If treatment is needed, send to Sydney to:
        - dehumidify in vacuum oven if necessary, with separate batches for mould-affected items
        - if mouldy, remove any visible growths first with cotton bud or pad and solution of isopropyl and cetramide
        - If sticky shed is present no special prior treatment is needed
        - Clean and prepare for digitisation
        - If necessary, advice regarding duration of treatment and temperature can be found at NFSA and also within the IASA TC-04 Guidelines
    ></span>
    
   * If no issues are present, procede with following instructions
3. Photograph each item, including all tape box inserts, tape labels, written inserts, etc.
4. Follow the digitising instructions outlined [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/06_audio_digitising.html){:target="_blank"}

### Workflow for handling born-digital audio files
1. Create inventory of files received
2. 


Reel-to-reel

Repair or replace lead tape and damaged splices if necessary
Clean using slow spool and specialist equipment (cotton pads and isopropyl/cetramide solution); also clean flange (spool) separately
Perform a second slow spool to repack tape
Cassette and DAT

Replace splices if necessary (cassette)
Fast forward and rewind to minimise print-through (cassette) and to repack tape (cassette and DAT)
If mouldy, bag up separately, to avoid cross-contamination, shelve in PARADISEC‚Äôs Dirty Room and minimise time in Ingestion Room, replay on designated dirty cassette machine


## Video workflow

### Workflow for handling video tape formats, film, or other non-file-based video formats
1. Create inventory of files received
2. 

### Workflow for handling born-digital video files
1. Create inventory of files received
	 * It is best to use MediaInfo batch export to collect necessary structural metadata such as overall/max Bitrate (needed for transcoding), duration (needed for QC), etc. (For more information about extracting metadtat with MediaInfo, click [here](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/PARADISEC_workflows/10_quality_control.html#mediainfo){:target="_blank"}).
	 * If not possible to use MediaInfo batch export, then use MediaInfo app and manually collect necessary metadata.
	 * Minimally, create a list or csv of files (Terminal print dir using "ls" is quickest).
