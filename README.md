# Technical workflows designed to facilitate archiving with PARADISEC

This site outlines some of the technical processes used when creating fit for purpose media files or creating archive-ready files. Most of this is done with [ffmpeg](www.ffmpeg.org) or [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud.html) from CC2018 and later (Premiere, Media Encoder, Audition).

Processes that will be outlined include the following:

**Data Management Workflows for CoEDL and PARADISEC**


**[Video processing](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/video_transcoding/)** 
1. changing video formats (.MTS/.AVI/.MPEG/.MP4, etc -> .MP4 or .MXF)
2. creating compressed versions
3. creating archival versions
4. adding external audio to video
5. synchronising a secondary audio track to a video track
6. extracting audio from video
7. concatenating multiple video files
8. repairing metadata problems (video with problematic properties)

**Audio procesing:**
1. resampling
2. mixing multiple tracks
