(Audio) </h3> <ul> <li> <p>Avoid internet browsing and any activity over the network during digitisation (these activities can cause interference, which may result in digital clips and unwanted errors in the signal), avoid using or turn off mobile phones or other mobile devices, including close wi-fi transmitters, and as a precaution, close any programs other than WaveLab during recording of audio.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reel-to-reel tapes go through Audio1 workstation (where StuderA810 is connected), cassette tapes go through either Audio1 or Audio2 workstations (both fitted with Tascam 122MKIIâ€™s cassette tape machines). Other sources, such as vinyl records, are to be connected separately as required and may, depending on how the device is connected, go through either Audio1 or Audio2 ingest stations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open the â€˜recordâ€™ dialogue box (the button with the red circle at the bottom of the screen) and type in the name and path of the file that you will create. The destination folder will, on either audio machine, be â€˜D:/WAV96 ingestâ€™ (shortcut on desktop) followed by the name of the audio file â€˜CollID-ItemID.wavâ€™. Relevant subparts of an item are indicated â€˜-Aâ€™, â€˜-Bâ€™ for example, and are inserted after the PI and before the extension.</p> </li> <li> <p>If digitization is being done from a copy tape (rather than an original), then â€˜copyâ€™ needs to be added into the third part of the filename (e.g. â€˜AC1-001-A_copyâ€™). This is so that we can avoid having to overwrite DOIs if a later file is produced from the original; the subsequent file can then be added, rather than replacing the â€˜copyâ€™ file, and it can be appropriately named (e.g. â€˜AC1-001-A_originalâ€™).</p> </li> <li> <p>If further work will be required on a file, such as splitting it into two separate channels, then the file should take a name that is distinct from the files that will ultimately be produced, to preclude any confusion. For instance, if the files to be archived will eventually be named AW1-001-A.wav and -B.wav and they are two sides of a single ingested recording that will require splitting, then name the file that comprises each of them as AW1-001_ The underscore as opposed to a dash will prevent the file from being erroneously archived. (Using Rif64 file format in Dobbin, we can now overcome our 2GB limit and so splitting of large files is not usually necessary).</p> </li> <li> <p>It is a good idea to run the signal for a few seconds and adjust the level on the source selector so that it maxes out at about -100 dB on the record dialogue (the white stickers on the source selector are a rough approximation of good gain levels for the selected source). After a good level is established, return the tape to the beginning and commence recording, leaving at least 5 seconds of silence before the signal begins.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjust the azimuth - this is the angle at which the tape meets the head, and we want to adjust it so we can get the sharpest (closest to original position of record head) possible signal. You will need to have the cover off the tape deck. In the monitoring window, enable Phase scope in WaveLab - you will see a graph in the bottom-right, with clusters of moving points showing as the tape plays; ideally, these should line up along one of the axes. [Cassettes] Take the small flat screwdriver, and tweak the screw on the bottom-left of the cassette playback head slot (not the right screw), while the tape is playing. Use only very small movements â€“ you donâ€™t want to unscrew the screw and lose it in the machine. Listen carefully â€“ you should hear the recording start to become sharper, as well as see the points start to line up more on the graph. Adjust the screw back after use. [R2R] Adjust the azimuth as it plays - use the allen key to turn the screw behind the heads. You should hear the recording get sharper, and see the moving points start to form a straight line in the graph in the monitoring window.</p> </li> <li> <p>pay attention to the recording and note any analogue errors, such as pops, hisses, buzzing, microphone bumps. These should be noted in the â€˜ingest notesâ€™ in the catalogue. More generally, note the overall quality of the recording â€” whether it is at all muffled, distorted or good and clean. This information should also go into â€˜ingest notesâ€™.</p> </li> <li> <p>analyse the file in Wavelab (shortcut: control-Y) (takes about 2 minutes for normal length file) â€” this generates temporary error markers wherever recording faults are apparent</p> <ul> <li>check any errors: if they are analogue errors, make a note of them in â€˜ingest notesâ€™; if they are digital errors, re-ingest â€“ file size, waveform, length sample rate might need to be checked and adjusted in Wavelab.

To do this all Mac users must switch on viewing of invisible or hidden files. Instructions can be found here: <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/macsoftware/how-show-hidden-files-in-mac-os-x-finder-funter-3520878/">http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/macsoftware/how-show-hidden-files-in-mac-os-x-finder-funter-3520878/</a></p> </li> <li>place files in <strong>parapd00470.srv.sydney.edu.au\Processing Area\forDobbin</strong>, this will trigger Nabu to create matching .imp and .id3 xml export files (see below section <em>Dobbin Processes for BWF generation</em> for details).

The exported metadata files are: <ul> <li><strong>parapd00470.srv.sydney.edu.au\Processing Area\xml[PID].imp.xml</strong></li> <li><strong>parapd00470.srv.sydney.edu.au\Processing Area\id3[PID].id3.v2_3.xml</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>XMLcheck monitors â€˜forDobbinâ€™ directory, and if a .wav file exists, it then also checks to see whether both the corresponding .imp.xml and .idv2_xml files exist. If both xml files are in the right directories, it moves the .wav file into the directory â€˜processed\fromDobbinâ€™.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dobbin monitors â€˜forDobbinâ€™ for .wav files. When it finds a .wav file, it begins processing it. To do this it requires the .imp.xml file and the .idv2_xml files to be in the correct locations. Dobbin outputs a sealed BWF file with a .wav suffix and a derivative .mp3 file. Dobbin also produces a .qua file for each of these. These .qua files are generated only after the files have been successfully written to the output directory, which is â€˜processed\fromDobbinâ€™.</p> </li> <li> <p>BWFhashgenerator monitors the â€˜processed\fromDobbinâ€™ directory for .wav files. If it finds one, along with a corresponding .mp3, .wav.qua and .mpqua, then it generates a hashsum for the wav and mp3, and writes them out to a file named [file]-checksum-PDSC_ADMIN.txt, which will contain the checksums for both wav and mp3 It then writes both .wav and .mp3, as well as the checksum .txt file, to â€˜toNabuâ€™, from which NABU harvests archive files.</p> </li> <li> <p>this process commences once the wav file is in the folder â€˜parapd00470.srv.sydney.edu.au\Processing Area\forDobbinâ€™ and the necessary metadata has been entered into the catalogue (see above).

Around -12dB is good â€“ not into the red.</li> <li>If monitoring is not showing up in WaveLab, go to Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Audio device. This should be set to MME-WDM SPDIF/ADAT (1+2) (RME Babyface) for both playback device AND recording device.</li> <li>Adjust the azimuth - this is the angle at which the tape meets the head, and we want to adjust it so we can get the sharpest possible recording. You will need to have the cover off the tape deck. In the monitoring window in WaveLab, you will see a graph in the bottomright, with clusters of moving points showing as the tape plays. Ideally, these should line up along one of the axes. Take the small flat screwdriver, and tweak the screw on the bottomleft of the cassette slot (not the right screw), while the tape is playing. Use only very small movements â€“ you donâ€™t want to unscrew the screw and lose it in the machine. Listen carefully â€“ you should hear the recording start to become sharper, as well as see the points start to line up more on the graph. Adjust the screw back after use.</li> <li>Hit record button in WaveLab. If it flashed red with â€˜waitingâ€™, hit again in order to record.

Clean the heads before loading a reel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put the reel on the left spindle. You need to line up the two metal parts of the spindle to slide it on. Thread the leader tape across the heads, with the tape coming off the reel counter-clockwise and being threaded under the first guide wheel, over the next, then past the heads. If the reel has no leader tape, USE GLOVES to handle the tape and add some new leader tape using the splicing tape and block. Thread it onto an empty take-up reel on the right and wind on a little bit. Lock the supply reel and take-up reel in place by lifting the top part of the metal spindle up and turning it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fast forward once through the tape onto supply reel and swap the reels over and re-spool. Press play to listen to the audio. Speed should be set to match that of the reel if possible - lowest setting on machine is 3 Â¾, so if tape has been recorded at a lower speed like 1 â…ž, record at 3 Â¾ and fix in post-processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjust the azimuth as it plays - use the Allen key to turn the top right hand side screw on the play head. You should hear the recording get sharper, and see the moving points start to form a straight line in the graph in the monitoring window.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjust the volume - on the top of the machine, there are two pairs of knobs labelled â€˜record levelâ€™ and â€˜rep/sync levelâ€™. The tape may have a mono recording on each side, in which case you will see information being captured in each channel, but these tracks will be from separate recording sessions. If this is the case, it is the RIGHT CHANNEL you want to look at in the monitoring window. To adjust the levels for this, you want to adjust the rightmost of the first pair of knobs, or the first â€˜rep/sync levelâ€™. As for cassettes, around 7 should be ok, but audio levels may vary quite a bit. If the tape is a stereo recording - i.e. audio was recording to both channels simultaneously - you will need to check that the levels are ok in both the left and right channel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you have finished one side, you need to check if there is a Side B. If the tape has two mono tracks, you will have been able to see this while recording the first side, but the audio in the left channel will have been recorded in reverse and needs to be discarded and done separately. Take off the empty reel, and remove now-full take-up reel. Flip it over and load onto the left spindle, and then put your empty original reel on the right, and follow the same process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you have recorded each mono side like this, save just the right channel from each track by going to File &gt; Save Special (Wave) &gt;: Save Right Channel As. This will save just the right channel as a mono file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save one as Side A and one as Side B * If the reel has a stereo recording on each side, there is no need to do this - just save each stereo file as Side A and B.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="restore-from-archive-proces-sa"> <a href="#restore-from-archive-proces-sa" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="restore-from-archive-proces-sa"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Restore from archive proces (SA) </h3> <p><strong>Restoring a file on Azoulay, which was modified or created in the last several days:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If it is one of your files you can restore it, otherwise this action must be performed by the Super User (either Abed Kassis, or Tom Honeyman).

This function automatically rotates the image according to which way the camera is being held (ie. Portrait or landscape), this is useful if the camera is vertical, but not useful if it is being held horizontally.</p> <p><strong><em>To turn off the Auto Rotate function on the camera:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>On the camera, press the menu button</li> <li>In the menu, use the arrow keys to scroll down to Auto Rotate</li> <li>Press the left/right arrows to change it to â€˜offâ€™</li> <li>If the Auto Rotate function is off, you can rotate images in the remote capture window before you take the photograph and it will also change the orientation of the view finder. It is also possible to rotate the photograph afterwards in the Image Browser window by selecting the photograph and selecting â€˜rotateâ€™ in the â€˜editâ€™ menu.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Folders</strong><br /> when starting the Remote Shooting window, you need to choose the folder that the photographs go into, the contents of which are displayed in the image browser. Put the photographs into a temporary folder (named eg. InProgess) first, and then, in â€˜Finderâ€™, to move the photographs to their proper folder afterwards. There are a few reasons for this:</p> <ul> <li>it is quicker to move images in â€˜Finderâ€™ after they have been taken than to change what folder they initially go in when the photo is taken.</li> <li>the image browser slows down if it has too many (more than about 100) images to display, so if you are dealing with a large amount of photographs, you can transfer them to their proper folder progressively.</li> <li>if you accidentally double click â€˜send to trashâ€™ it will not only delete all the photographs in the displayed in the Image Browser, but any other sub-folders that were also in the folder the photographs were saved in. It is all recoverable from the Trash, but is it still better to have a folder that has all its contents on display.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Shooting Settings in the Remote Capture Window</strong><br /></p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Photo Effect</em></strong> - changing the Photo Effect from â€˜Effect Offâ€™ to â€˜Vividâ€™ makes light pencil and faded ink stand out better.</li> <li> <p><strong><em>Focusing Point</em></strong> - the â€˜Manual Selection â€“ Centerâ€™ function means the process of taking the photograph and uploading it to the computer is slightly quicker because the camera does not refocus for each picture, because it automatically focuses on the centre of the image. However, if there is nothing in the centre of the page (for example the text is only at the top of the page, or in a column down the side of the page) or the writing is very pale, the image will be out of focus and it is better to change the Focusing Point to â€˜Automatic Selectionâ€™. Generally, leaving it on â€˜General Selectionâ€™ lessens the chance of a fuzzy picture because the camera re-focuses for each photograph.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Macro</strong> - if the â€˜Automatic Selectionâ€™ focusing point is on and the image is still fuzzy, then change the Macro to â€˜Onâ€™.</p> </li> <li><strong>Lighting</strong> - having the lighting rig further away from the page makes the light more even. A higher lighting rig will also make it less likely to appear in large images where the camera has zoomed out, so it will not have to be moved very often. If the paper is shiny or there is pencil which reflects the light, putting paper light shades on the light bulbs or turning them off altogether (if there is adequate lighting from the room light or a window) reduces the reflection.</li> </ul> <p><strong>General advice</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can also release the shutter button by pressing the spacebar.</li> <li>You can change the name of an individual in the Image Browser window by double clicking on it.</li> <li>For images with little contrast (eg. Light pencil, faded ink), turning off the Tungsten light bulbs and, if there is daylight from a window, the room lights, as well as changing the Photo Effect in the Shooting Settings to â€˜Vividâ€™ is a good way to get a clearer image.</li> <li>If taking a lot of photographs of papers of a uniform size, drawing pencil dots on the backing cardboard to line up the paper speeds up the process. Folded-over post-it notes are a good way to stick down curling paper.</li> <li>If you want to make a very small adjustment to the zoom, it is easier to adjust the height of the camera tripod than adjusting the zoom on the computer.</li> <li>A suggestion for making copying books easier: if it were possible to make the automatic page numbering â€˜oddâ€™ or â€˜evenâ€™, then every second page could be copied. This would be useful when photographing books because you could photograph all the left-hand pages and then all the right-hand pages, and you would only have to turn the page while keeping the book in place, rather than having to move it after taking each photograph.</li> </ul> <p><a href="#">Back to top</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
