# Technical workflows designed to facilitate archiving with PARADISEC

This site outlines some of the technical processes used when creating fit for purpose media files or creating archive-ready files. Most of this is done with [ffmpeg](www.ffmpeg.org) or [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud.html) from CC2018 and later (Premiere, Media Encoder, Audition).
