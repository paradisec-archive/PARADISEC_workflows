    "content": ". This page is dedicated to helping you begin the seemingly overwhelming process of getting your materials organised and eventually archived with PARADISEC (Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Engangered Cultures). STEP 1: Sign up as a user with PARADISEC . Signing up with PARADISEC means you become a PARADISEC user. As a user you can access data in an open collections after agreeing to PARADISEC’s conditions of access, or you may send a request to access data that has restrictions on viewing by following instructions provided by the collector on their catalog page. You also need to sign up with PARADISEC if you wish to deposit material to the archive. The process of signing up is simple- go to the PARASDISEC catalog web page: http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/, and click on Sign up in the upper right‐hand corner. Once you sign up, you get an automated message informing you to check your email to confirm your account, . “A message with a confirmation link has been sent to your email address. Please open the link to activate your account” . Click on the link in your email to confirm. Congratulations, you are now a PARADISEC user! It is recommended that you browse the collections held in PARADISEC so that you can investigate the different ways collections can be organised. Below are a some examples: . | PhD thesis: OE1 is a collection of narratives and wordlists that the depositor used in writing their PhD thesis. This includes the segmented audio files that are linked to the exemplar utterances within the thesis. | Field methods course: The MEU1 collection holds all recordings generated during a field methods course. Note how the different type of events (classroom recordings vs breakout sessions) are kept together by the nature of the item names. | Separate collections for each language/dialect/variety: Explore two of this depositor’s 27 collections, SDM42 and SDM45. Each of these collections feature one language variety. There is no limit as to how many collections you can create. | Many languages in one collection: In the DD1 collection, the depositor has included recordings of over 25 languages, collected since 2010. This collection is still growing! | . STEP 2: Contact PARADISEC to help you create a new collection . Only PARADISEC administrators can create a collection in the catalog. When you are ready for us to create a collection, contact the PARADISEC administration at admin@paradisec.org.au or the CoEDL Data Manager. To begin with you will need to provide us with the following information: . | Collection ID | A brief title of your collection | A more detailed description of your collection | Funding body (if applicable) (e.g. ARC, ELDP, etc.) | Grant identifier (if applicable) (e.g. CoEDL = CE140100041 or Wellsprings = FL130100111) | . Preliminary exploration of your files . Before you contact PARADISEC, take a look at your files and determine how you want your collection(s) presented. Do you need one collection? Or more than one? This is the time for you to reflect upon how you want your material organised in the archive. Information to provide to PARADISEC . Once you have decided upon which files you would like to archive, come up with a name and description for your collection. As for the Collection ID, PARADISEC administrators can help you come up with this- the collection ID should be a unique identifier (could be your initials in all caps and a digit, or the ISO language code). Example collection IDs: JM1, JCM4, OE1, MEU1, etc. The digit is required and it distinguishes your collection from that of someone with the same initials (John Mansfield, Julia Miller, etc), but also allows for multiple collections, should you require, e.g. JM1, JM2… JM85. STEP 3: Organise materials to be sent to collection . PARADISEC’s metadata spreadsheet . PARADISEC has created a spreadsheet that allows us to automatically create the catalog metadata for items in your collection. You can acces the spreadsheet here. (If the .xlsx file does not download automatically, then right-click on the link to save the file). Please do not alter the structure of the spreadsheet, as this will prevent the auto-upload process for us. Once your collection has been created, and has been populated with the metadata for your items, you can edit you collection information directly via the catalog pages. You can add details such as: . | your institutional affiliation | alternate names of the language(s) | you can set the map by zooming in on the map feature and selecting an area, or set it automatically by selecting the country or language | you can define/change access conditions | you can even assign editor privileges to a colleague or research assistant to help you update the collection’s metadata | . PARADISEC’s file naming conventions . Now comes the thrilling task of making sure your files are named appropriately. Getting your file names in order should come after you have created your collection and after you have settled on the organisation of your items (recording events) within your collection. ANATOMY OF A PARADISEC FILE NAME Say you have, for example, a file that you named 20150908‐wordlist‐01.wav while in the field. This in‐field naming convention includes the date in ISO format (YYYYMMDD). The (‐wordlist) marks this as being from a session involving wordlist elicitation. The (‐01) indicates that this is the first track of the session. You will have your own conventions. The name 20150908‐wordlist‐01.wav does not fit with the PARADISEC naming conventions. First of all, there needs to be a collection ID followed by a hyphen, and then only two more parts separated by hyphens: CollectionID-ItemID‐ContentFile. | CollectionID is your PARADISEC collection ID and it typically has the shape of your initials in capital letters and a number. This ID can be determined by you, but must be confirmed as available for use by the CoEDL Data Manager or a PARADISEC administrator. This ID is created when you set up a collection in PARADISEC. Mine could be JCM1 . | ItemID is your PARADISEC item ID. An item could be a cassette tape, or now in the born-digital age, it is typically an recording event containing all related files from that session- audio, video, transcriptions). You must use a terse description here. You may use an underscore ( _ ) if you need a separator; hyphens ( ‐ ) are prohibited within your Item ID as they are reserved PARADISEC operators. You could have speaker initials in your item name (JB), description of the task (wordlist), field site (BIMA). | ContentFile is the final necessary part to a file name. This part of the name allows you to enumerate files of the same format, i.e. photos with 001, 002, etc, or multiple tracks of a single audio or video session. You can distinguish type of microphone used for an audio track in this part of the file name, e/g/ -LM (lapel mic) or -HM (for head mounted mic). So if your original file was named 20150908‐wordlist‐01.wav, you could try something like this: JCM01‐20150908_wordlist‐01.wav . | . Note: Even if your item contains only one file, and thus does not need to be differentiated from other files in the item, you still need to have this third part of the file name. You could use -00, -01, -wordlist01, -original, etc. TEMPLATE: [CollectionID] - [ItemID] - [ContentFile] . file extension . | Coll ID | Item ID | Content | Extension | . | JCM01 | 20150908_wordlist | 01 | .wav | . Note: No spaces or special characters are allowed in your file names, and only the two hyphens seen above are allowed. Underscores are fine. File names should not exceed 30 characters, excluding file extensions. PARADISEC’s deposit form . And lastly, you need to fill out a deposit form that provides PARADISEC with your contact information, access conditions for your collection, including any restrictions. Fill in the form, sign it, scan or photograph it, and email it back to us. We keep this digital record with your collection. STEP 4: Sending your files to PARADISEC . If you are planing to archive digital files with PARADISEC, and your institution is part of the Australian Access Federation (AAF), you can sign up for a Cloudstor account. Once you do, you get 1TB of free storage available to you instantly. You can also send us OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive links. These options are the best means to transfer files to PARADISEC. If you do not use any of those cloud storage options, but would like to transfer your files this way, contact PARADISEC or the CoEDL Data Manager and we can create a Cloudstor folder for you to use for transferring files to us. If uploading files to a cloud service is not possible due to a lack of computer access or poor internet connections, you can post a hard drive of your materials to PARADISEC at: . PARADISEC Room 3019, Sydney Conservatorium of Music C41 The University of Sydney NSW 2006 AUSTRALIA . Or to the CoEDL Data Manager at: .

    "doc": "Video Processing - MXF",
    "title": "MXF",
    "content": "This page outlines how to create lossless JPEG2000 .MXF videos using Adobe Media Encoder (CC 2018 or later). This is for digital-to-digital transcoding. Contact PARADISEC if you have analog material to digitise. PARADISEC adheres to the current best-practice standards for video archiving as set by the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA). Define Encoding Settings - Making an Encoding Preset . The first thing we need to do is select the settings that we can use each time we want to create a lossless J2K .MXF video. To do this, we need to create an Encoding Preset. Go to the top Media Encoder CC menu to “Presets” and then select “Create Encoding Preset”. A new Preset window will open up. Look at the image below to see the settings you should choose. Each will be explained below. Preset name and format . First you should give the preset a meaningful name, I have chosen Lossless J2k (8-bit). The main reason for this particular name is to differentiate this preset from others you might use for different workflows (I will discus why I add the distinction 8-bit below). For the format, select JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a. Once you select this format, you are then offered these choices for the Based on Preset field: . You can leave the new default of RGBA 4:4:4:4 12-bit (BCs@L5). This value will change once we make further refinements in our settings. Leave the remaining settings in this section as their defaults (Comments field left blank, Export Video and Export Audio boxes ticked). Video settings . Edit only settings in the Video and Audio tabs. Settings in the other tabs (Effects, Captions, Publish) should be left untouched. Because we selected the JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a format above, the video codec will automatically be set to JPEG 2000 in this section. The basic video settings options will have changed to those appropriate for this format. Make certain Match Source is selected, this will automatically tick all the boxes below (if they are not already), retaining the same settings as those of the original file for the following fields Width, Height, Frame Rate, Field Order, and Aspect [ratio]. Chroma should be set to YUV 4:2:2 with a depth of 8-bit. In the rare case your original video has a colour depth of 10-bit, select the 10-bit option. To determine the bit depth of a video, use MediaInfo; the file’s bit depth is listed in the MediaInfo metadata output report. Note: If you are using CC2018: Set the Broadcast Profile to Level 6 (Lossless). This determines the maximum sampling and bit rates for the output file. You can see all the drop down choices offered below: . Note: If you are using CC2020: You need only tick the box for Lossless Compression; The Maximum Bitrate and Broadcast Profile automatically get set to 100,000 Mbps and Level 7 - 3200Mbps or Lossless, respectively . Audio settings . There are not many adjustments that need to be made to the audio settings (see image below). The Audio Codec will already be set to Uncompressed with a Sample Rate of 48,000 Hz. due to the choice of the video format of JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a. Make certain the Channels field is set to 2. If you are given a video that has been recorded with surround sound, there could be as many as 6 channels. Our standard is to have 2 channel stereo audio output for our .MXF files. 6 channel video files have caused problems for editing/playback in programs such as Adobe Premiere, etc. Then Set the Sample Size to 24 bit. The remaining settings . The remaining settings located underneath the tab area should all be left with the default settings (see image below). This means that the following boxes should all be left unticked: Use Maximum Render Quality, Use Previews, Set Start Timecode, and Render Alpha Channel Only. Leave the Time Interpolation set to Frame Sampling. This settings handles motion smoothing if you change the output file’s frames per second. Using MediaInfo to check your output file metadata . MediaInfo is the best method to access all of the file specifications you need in order to understand the structure of your media files. You should know the underlying specifications of your original file before you do any transcoding. This ensures that you are able to set your output settings to match the relevant specs of the original. Below is a side-by-side comparison of the MediaInfo outputs, with added red asterisks to highlight some of the specs to be aware of: . I have pulled out some of those specs for comparison in the table below. You will be creating a video that has an increased file size from the original; this is because the bitrate will have increased substantially due to the transcoding process for lossless .MXF. The durations need to be similar (within +/- 500ms). Unless you clear any changes in specifications with the depositor first, you will need to keep the following specs the same: aspect ratio, frame rate, color space, and bit depth. The audio channels may change from the original; an original video with six audio channels (surround sound) is problematic in Adobe. If the depositor requires the six channels to remain, this workflow will not handle it. Another one will need to be configured. Finally, the compression mode for the .MXF MUST indicate it is lossless. If it is not lossless, you need to look at your settings and try again. | SPECIFICATION | ORIGINAL .MTS | ARCHIVAL .MXF | . | Name | 00050.mts | 0005.mxf | . | Format | BDAV | MXF | . | Format profile | Blu-Ray Video | OP-1a v1.2 | . | File size | 31.5 MiB | 785 MiB | . | Duration | 37 s 350 ms | 37 s 440 ms | . | (Max.) Overall bitrate | 13.7 Mb/s | 176 Mb/s | . | Aspect ratio | 16:9 | 16:9 | . | Frame rate | 25 fps | 25 fps | . | Color space | YUV | YUV | . | Chroma subsampling | 4:2:0 | 4:2:2 | . | Bit depth | 8 bits | 8 bits | . | Compression mode | n/a | LOSSLESS | . | Audio channels | 2 | 2 | . | Sampling rate | 48 kHz | 48 kHz | . Once you transcode the original file to an .MXF, you will need to take a look at the .MXF file metadata to determine whether or not you have created an appropriate match to the original. Note: You can do this in batches, as MediaInfo allows you to open multiple files at one time. On a Mac, you get one MediaInfo window with a dropdown menu to select which file you want to see in the active report; on Windows, separate MediaInfo windows will open for each file selected. Using an MXF player to check the quality of your newly created file . Once you have checked the file metadata with MediaInfo, you will need to play through the entire video to see if there were any issues in your transcoding process. I have created a lossless .MXF that had playback issues, so this step in the quality checking process in very important. Unfortunately, there are not many players that can handle .MXF-formatted video. You need to find a player that lets you see if there is jumpy playback, dropped frames, or any other errors. Note: VLC can open and play .MXF files, but the playback is always jumpy, so you cannot determine if it is the player or your transcoding that is the source of the jumpy playback. This is not acceptable for our workflow. I suggest using Telestream’s Switch player. You can get a free trial, but the price for the basic player is under AU$15. With the basic license, the viewer will show the Switch watermark in the upper right corner of the video during playback of .MXF files, but this has no bearing on its functionality for our task, playback. Switch is not to be used in any transcoding or editing capacity. You can see in the upper left corner that there is some quality reporting. Pay special attention to the dropped frames. If there are any dropped frames, you will need to re-transcode the file. Note: If you are running other memory hungry programs in the background when you are trying to preview your .MXF with Switch, you will very likely have a report of dropped frames. You should quit all other processes while you are doing your playback reviews. Explanation of the Specifications used to create lossless MXF . | JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a is the MXF (Material Exchage Format) Operational Pattern 1a (OP1a), with lossles JPEG 2000 in a generic container (for more information see the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative FADGI) . | YUV 4:2:2 with a depth of 8 bit is the Chroma Subsampling suggested by IASA for born-digital .MXF. Y (or often Y′) stands for the luma, or brightness, component; U and V are the two colour components. YUV colour encoding takes into consideration human perception thus creating an output that has masked any human-noticable distortions (for more information see YUV). | 4:2:2 denotes the vertical and horizontal subsampling (for more information read Charles Poynton’s work on Chroma subsampling HERE). | 8-bits per channel is typically the bit depth for many of the original .MOV, .MTS, .AVI, .MP4, etc. video files we handle. Using a 10-bit depth would needlessly increase the file-size while adding no improved quality. | Broadcast profile determines the maximum sampling and bit rates of the output file. Level 6 lossless (L6) is 520 Msamples/s and 1600Mbits/s. Level 7 lossless (L7) is 520 Msamples /s and and unspecified Max Bitrate. | For further information of the Media Encoder export settings mentioned above look HERE. | . Return to top of page . ",
