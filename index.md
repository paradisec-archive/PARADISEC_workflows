This site outlines some of the technical processes used when creating fit for purpose media files or creating archive-ready files. Most of this is done with [ffmpeg](www.ffmpeg.org) or [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud.html) from CC2018 and later (Premiere, Media Encoder, Audition).

Processes that will be outlined include the following:

## Suggested specifications for digital capture

## Data management
* Metadata entry with PARADISEC-formatted spreadsheets
* Metadata entry with LaMeta
* File naming requirements for PARADISEC

## [Video processing](https://paradisec-archive.github.io/video_transcoding/)
* Creating lossless JPEG2000 .MXF video files for archiving with PARADISEC (archival copy)
* Creating .MP4 (H.264) video files for archiving with PARADISEC (access copy)
* Handling video with problematic properties
* Transcoding or rewrapping for other purposes
* Extracting audio from video

## Audio procesing
* Resampling audio to meet PARADISEC archiving standards
* Creating stereo track from mono track

## PARADISEC Ingestion Workflow Model

* Pre-ingestion (audio tapes)
  * Assess collection (Admin and PD)
  * Rights
  * Transportation
  * Receipt of materials at ingestion point (Admin)
  * metadata
  * photograph tape covers and casings to capture all handwritten metadata
  * prepare tapes for ingestion (Audio)
* Ingestion Processes
  * Wavelab ingestion processes â€“ Sydney Lab (Audio)
  * Dobbin Processes for BWF generation (Audio)
  * Ingestion of photographic slides
  * Digital text
* University of Melbourne ingestion unit
* Restore from archive process (SA)
